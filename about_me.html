					<p class="about-copy">My name is Andrew Cloud, but I've gone by Cloud ever since my friends decided it was more fun to say. I'm a junior at Northeastern working towards a Marketing and Interactive Media combined major, meaning I've got one foot in business and the other in design.</p>
					
					<p class="about-copy">Over the past few months, I've been working towards bolstering the design-side of my skills by becoming more involved in projects on-campus and trying to tackle some personal projects. Along the way, I've picked up non-university coursework to develop my technical abilities. I got tired of saying to myself "I wish I could make that" and made it my goal to be able to say "yeah, I could make that." Or at the very least, "yeah, I could make that... in like a month, maybe?"</p>

					<p class="about-copy">The long-term(ish) goal is to break into UX/UI. But I'd be stoked to work in any capacity that lets me combined design, code, and marketing. As for who I am when I'm an actual, y'know, person, and not trying to sell myself: you'll probably find me at an overly hipster concert, shooting around at the gym, or lamenting the fact that there'll never be a new episode of Parks and Rec.</p>
